Ordnance Survey VectorMap Local Bruised
=======================================

A set of QGIS QML files for OS VectorMap Local based on Cloudmade's (http://maps.cloudmade.com/#) Midnight Commander colour scheme designed by Stamen (http://stamen.com/clients/cloudmade).

For OS VML tables loaded by Snowflake's GoLoader. Table and field names will differ if loaded with other applications like Loader! or Productivity Suite.

*NOTE:* I set the background colour to my QGIS project to [RGB 0, 54, 78] to fill in the areas outside of the urban extent.
