Ordnance Survey MasterMap
=========================

QGIS QML style files for Ordnance Survey MasterMap tables stored in PostGIS and created with Snowflake's GoLoader software.  The tables include all the fields required for correctly rendering text such as text font, text height, text orientation and text position.  The data driven definitions in QGIS just love these fields.

The styles were cobbled together from the OS support pages (http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/products/topography-layer.html) and SLDs from OS and Lutra Consulting (http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/resources/ostranslator).
