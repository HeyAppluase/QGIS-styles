Ordnance Survey Strategi
========================

Ordnance Survey's open dataset Strategi styled for use in QGIS.

Originally converted from NTF to PostGIS using FME to create four tables - strategi_text, strategi_point, strategi_line and strategi_area.  If the data is downloaded from the OS Open Data portal it is split into multiple shapefiles which can then be loaded into your database of choice.  The greyscale QML files match the shapefile schema.
